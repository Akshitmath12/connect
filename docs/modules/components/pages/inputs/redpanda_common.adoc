== Fields

=== `topics`

A list of topics to consume from. Multiple comma separated topics can be listed in a single element. When a `consumer_group` is specified partitions are automatically distributed across consumers of a topic, otherwise all partitions are consumed.

Alternatively, it's possible to specify explicit partitions to consume from with a colon after the topic name, e.g. `foo:0` would consume the partition 0 of the topic foo. This syntax supports ranges, e.g. `foo:0-10` would consume partitions 0 through to 10 inclusive.

Finally, it's also possible to specify an explicit offset to consume from by adding another colon after the partition, e.g. `foo:0:10` would consume the partition 0 of the topic foo starting from the offset 10. If the offset is not present (or remains unspecified) then the field `start_from_oldest` determines which offset to start from.


*Type*: `array`


```yml
# Examples

topics:
  - foo
  - bar

topics:
  - things.*

topics:
  - foo,bar

topics:
  - foo:0
  - bar:1
  - bar:3

topics:
  - foo:0,bar:1,bar:3

topics:
  - foo:0-5
```

=== `regexp_topics`

Whether listed topics should be interpreted as regular expression patterns for matching multiple topics. When topics are specified with explicit partitions this field must remain set to `false`.


*Type*: `bool`

*Default*: `false`

=== `rack_id`

A rack specifies where the client is physically located and changes fetch requests to consume from the closest replica as opposed to the leader replica.


*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `""`

=== `start_from_oldest`

Determines whether to consume from the oldest available offset, otherwise messages are consumed from the latest offset. The setting is applied when creating a new consumer group or the saved offset no longer exists.


*Type*: `bool`

*Default*: `true`

=== `fetch_max_bytes`

Sets the maximum amount of bytes a broker will try to send during a fetch. Note that brokers may not obey this limit if it has records larger than this limit. This is the equivalent to the Java fetch.max.bytes setting.


*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `"50MiB"`

=== `fetch_min_bytes`

Sets the minimum amount of bytes a broker will try to send during a fetch. This is the equivalent to the Java fetch.min.bytes setting.


*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `"1B"`

=== `fetch_max_partition_bytes`

Sets the maximum amount of bytes that will be consumed for a single partition in a fetch request. Note that if a single batch is larger than this number, that batch will still be returned so the client can make progress. This is the equivalent to the Java fetch.max.partition.bytes setting.


*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `"1MiB"`

=== `auto_replay_nacks`

Whether messages that are rejected (nacked) at the output level should be automatically replayed indefinitely, eventually resulting in back pressure if the cause of the rejections is persistent. If set to `false` these messages will instead be deleted. Disabling auto replays can greatly improve memory efficiency of high throughput streams as the original shape of the data can be discarded immediately upon consumption and mutation.


*Type*: `bool`

*Default*: `true`
