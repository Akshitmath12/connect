This processor sends the contents of user prompts to the OpenAI API, which generates responses. By default, the processor submits the entire payload of each message as a string, unless you use the `prompt` configuration field to customize it.

To learn more about chat completion, see the https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/chat-completions[OpenAI API documentation^].

== Fields

=== `server_address`

The Open API endpoint that the processor sends requests to. Update the default value to use another OpenAI compatible service.


*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `"https://api.openai.com/v1"`

=== `api_key`

The API key for OpenAI API.
[CAUTION]
====
This field contains sensitive information that usually shouldn't be added to a config directly, read our xref:configuration:secrets.adoc[secrets page for more info].
====



*Type*: `string`


=== `model`

The name of the OpenAI model to use.


*Type*: `string`


```yml
# Examples

model: gpt-4o

model: gpt-4o-mini

model: gpt-4

model: gpt4-turbo
```

=== `prompt`

The user prompt you want to generate a response for. By default, the processor submits the entire payload as a string.


*Type*: `string`


=== `system_prompt`

The system prompt to submit along with the user prompt.
This field supports xref:configuration:interpolation.adoc#bloblang-queries[interpolation functions].


*Type*: `string`


=== `max_tokens`

The maximum number of tokens that can be generated in the chat completion.


*Type*: `int`


=== `temperature`

What sampling temperature to use, between 0 and 2. Higher values like 0.8 will make the output more random, while lower values like 0.2 will make it more focused and deterministic.

We generally recommend altering this or top_p but not both.


*Type*: `float`


=== `user`

A unique identifier representing your end-user, which can help OpenAI to monitor and detect abuse.
This field supports xref:configuration:interpolation.adoc#bloblang-queries[interpolation functions].


*Type*: `string`


=== `top_p`

An alternative to sampling with temperature, called nucleus sampling, where the model considers the results of the tokens with top_p probability mass. So 0.1 means only the tokens comprising the top 10% probability mass are considered.

We generally recommend altering this or temperature but not both.


*Type*: `float`


=== `frequency_penalty`

Number between -2.0 and 2.0. Positive values penalize new tokens based on their existing frequency in the text so far, decreasing the model's likelihood to repeat the same line verbatim.


*Type*: `float`


=== `presence_penalty`

Number between -2.0 and 2.0. Positive values penalize new tokens based on whether they appear in the text so far, increasing the model's likelihood to talk about new topics.


*Type*: `float`


=== `seed`

If specified, our system will make a best effort to sample deterministically, such that repeated requests with the same seed and parameters should return the same result. Determinism is not guaranteed.


*Type*: `int`


=== `stop`

Up to 4 sequences where the API will stop generating further tokens.


*Type*: `array`
